**distribute_airdrop.rs:** Distributes tokens (CPI to Staking and Treasury Management).
**events.rs:** AirdropDistributedEvent.
**utils.rs:** CPI calls to Staking for eligibility, Treasury Management for funds.
**Key Interactions:**

**5. Treasury Management Program**
Collects taxes and manages fund distribution to staking, airdrops, and vesting.

**lib.rs:** Program ID and entrypoint.
**constants.rs:** Tax rates, pool addresses.
**errors.rs:** Errors like InsufficientFunds, UnauthorizedWithdrawal.

**state/**
**mod.rs:** Re-exports.

**Key Interconnections and Optimizations**
To ensure the VeraLux ecosystem operates efficiently:
**CPI Calls:** Each program’s utils.rs includes CPI logic for secure interactions (e.g., Staking calls Token Management for transfers).
**Public Getter Functions:** Provide read-only access to state (e.g., Governance queries Staking’s voting power).
**Event Emissions:** Enable real-time updates for the VeraLux website’s Profile Page.

**Optimizations**
**Modularity:** Separate programs allow independent upgrades and reduce complexity.
**Shared Testing:** The tests/ directory at the root supports integration tests to verify inter-program behavior.
**CPI Organization:** For programs with heavy CPI usage (e.g., Treasury Management), a cpi/ subdirectory could organize calls (e.g., cpi/token.rs).
**Event Consistency:** Standardized event naming ensures uniform frontend integration.

**This structure provides an optimal foundation for VeraLux, balancing scalability, maintainability, and security while meeting the ecosystem’s multi-contract needs. Each program is self-contained yet interconnected, supporting VeraLux’s vision of a robust, community-driven platform.**
